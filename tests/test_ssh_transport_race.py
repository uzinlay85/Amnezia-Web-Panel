"""force_disconnect() must not tear down a transport mid-command.

Before run_command held _conn_lock for the whole exec, pool eviction could
null self.client between ensure_connected() and exec_command(), surfacing as
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'open_session'. This test blocks the fake
exec until another thread calls force_disconnect(); with the fix the eviction
waits for the in-flight command and the command succeeds.
